Inform\nme of a deed that would earn me Paradise.”\n\n“Conduct yourself with people in the same manner as you would want them to\nbehave towards you and refrain from doing to them what you would not want them\nto do to you,” advised the Prophet (s.a.w.) and then added, “Let go of the\nreins (for I have to go for jihad).”[3]\n\n\n### The Equity of Imam Ali\n\n_Shu’bi_ narrates:\n\nLike the other youths, I entered the vast open ground of Kufah, where I\nwitnessed Amirul Mu'mineen (a.s.) standing beside two containers which were\nfilled with gold and silver coins. He had a small whip in his hand. A huge\ncrowd had gathered around him and he kept them back by means of his whip, to\nprevent them from hampering the distribution of the money.\n\nThe Imam (a.s.) began distributing the money amongst the people until nothing\nremained for himself and he returned home empty-handed.\n\nI returned home and said to my father, “I witnessed a very strange act today\nbut I fail to comprehend if this person’s action was good or bad because he\nnever retained anything for himself!”\n\nMy father inquired, “Who was the person?”\n\n“Amirul Mu'mineen (a.s.),” I replied and then went on to narrate what had\ntranspired earlier. Upon hearing Ali’s (a.s.) fairness in distributing the\nmoney, my father began to weep and said to me, “My son, you have witnessed the\nmost excellent person from amongst the people.”[4]",
