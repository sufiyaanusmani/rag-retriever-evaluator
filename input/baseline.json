      "text": "I again refer those requiring more detail to my work _Adl-i Ilahi_\n(Divine justice)\n\n## The Principle of Justice in Islamic Culture\n\nIn Shi'ism, the principle of justice is one of the principles of religion.\nJustice in Islamic culture is divided into divine justice and human justice.\nDivine justice is subdivided into creative justice and legislative justice.\nHuman justice is subdivided into individual justice and social justice. The\nconcept of justice considered unique to Shi'ism that has taken its place among\nthe principles of religion in Shi'ism is divine justice. This type of justice\nspecifically arises in the context of the Islamic worldview.\n\nTo believe in divine justice means to believe that God acts in accordance with\ntruth and justice, both in the system of the creation and in the system of\nlegislation, and never shows injustice. Justice has become one of the\nprinciples of Shi'ism because some who denied human choice and freedom\nappeared among the Muslims.\n\nThey arrived at a belief regarding divine decree and foreordination that was\nwholly inconsistent with human freedom. They denied the principle of cause and\neffect in the overall system of the universe and in the system of human\nconduct. They came to believe that divine decree acts directly and without\nintermediation. According to this belief, fire does not cause to burn, but God\ncauses to burn; a magnetic field in no way attracts iron, but God directly\ndraws the iron to the lines of the magnetic field; man does not the good or\nevil deed, but God directly carries out the good or evil deed through the\nhuman form.\n\nHere a major question arose. If the system of cause and effect has no reality,\nand if man himself has no real role in choosing his actions, then what\nfunction is served by rewarding or punishing the individual for his acts? Why\ndoes God mete out rewards to some people and take them to paradise and punish\nothers and take them to hell when He Himself has carried out both the good\ndeed and the evil one? To punish human individuals when they have not\npossessed the least choice and freedom of their own is injustice and contrary\nto the categorical principle of divine justice.\n\nThe Shi'a at large and a party among the Sunnis called the Mu'tazilites,\nrelying on decisive rational and transmitted proofs, denied that man is\ndetermined and that divine decree and fore-ordination act directly on the\nuniverse; they regarded these ideas as immical to the principle of justice and\nso became known as the People of Justice (‘ _adliyya_).\n\nAlthough justice is a divine principle (that is, linked with one of the\nattributes of God), it is likewise a human principle because it is linked with\nhuman freedom and choice. Therefore, among the Shi'a and the Mu'tazilites,\nbelief in the principle of justice means belief in the principle of human\nfreedom, human responsibility, and human creativity.\n\nThe question concerning divine justice that generally - especially in our own\ntime - draws the most attention has to do with certain social inequalities:\nHow is it that some individuals are beautiful and others ugly, some healthy\nand others sickly, some comfortable and affluent and others empty-handed and\nindigent? Would divine justice not require all individuals to be equal with\nrespect to wealth, lifespan, offspring, social position, reputation, and\nreceipt of love? Can anything but divine decree and foreordination be\nresponsible for these inequalities?\n\nThe roots of this question and the confusion underlying it are two. One is\ninattention to the nature of the operation of divine decree and\nforeordination. The questioner has imagined that they work\ndirectly.[41](epub.html#f_76ed63c1_41) For instance, wealth would be directly\nand without the intervention of any cause or agency transported from the\ndivine treasuries of the unseen and parcelled out at people's doors, and the\nsame would hold for health, beauty, power, position, love, offspring, and\nother blessings.\n\nThe questioner has failed to note that no sort of sustenance, whether material\nor spiritual, is apportioned directly from the treasury of the unseen. Rather,\ndivine decree has produced a system and originated a series of norms and laws.\nWhatever anyone seeks, he must seek through that system and those norms.",

All these are taken into account, but their influences\nare not decisive as free will is preserved.\n\n## 5) Religious Determinism\n\nThere are some sects in Islam and other religions which believe that Allah\ndecides for us and none of us is free to do what he wants.\n\nThis belief is mainly due to lack of knowledge. For instance, they say whether\na person prays or not, whether he is truthful or not, whether he is an\noppressor or not, is all because of Allah's will and human beings have no say\nor fault in this matter.\n\nThis belief was developed by some theists to preserve monotheism. They thought\nthat if we say people are free in their life, it means that Allah has nothing\nto do in this part of the world and it is up to human beings to do whatever\nview monotheism demands the denial of any human role in action. They also\nmisunderstood some verses of the Glorious Qur'an.\n\nThis view is completely against Divine justice. It is also against Divine\nwisdom (hikmah). According to this view sending prophets and inviting people\nto the religion and Divine commands are useless. If this view were true, then\nAllah would not have assigned rewards and punishments for our actions.\n\nThe evil intentions and politics of some despotic rulers like the Umayyads and\nAbbasids is another reason for the appearance of this belief in Islamic\nculture. They spread this belief for their own desires and benefits. They said\nthat Allah had given power to them and no one was able to interfere in His\ndeeds. So no one was allowed to protest against them. If the Ahl al-Bayt\n(people of the household of the Prophet) were not allowed to rule, it was\nbecause Allah wanted this, or if Yazid as a ruler did many bad things nobody\nhad a right to say anything. For example, when Imam Husain was martyred,\n'Ubayd Allah, the son of Marjanah and the commander of Kufa, took members of\nthe Ahl al-Bayt as prisoners.",
