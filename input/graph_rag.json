      "text": "Here are some facts extracted from the provided text:\n\nScience -> Complementary -> RELIGIOUS FAITH\nScience -> Complementarity -> RELIGIOUS FAITH\n\nThis is not accomplished by science, by discovery of the laws governing nature\nand man. It is born of the sanctification and exaltation of certain values in\none's spirit, which values in turn are born of a range of elevated aptitudes\nin man, which result further, from a particular conception and way of thinking\nabout the universe and man that one can acquire neither in the laboratory nor\nfrom syllogism and deduction.\n\nHistory shows the consequences of disjoining science and faith. Where faith\nhas been, and science not, individuals' humanitarian efforts have produced no\ngreat effect-at times, no good effect. Sometimes they have given rise to\nfanaticisms, stagnations, and ruinous conflicts. Human history is filled with\nsuch events. Where science has been, with the place of faith left empty, as in\nsome contemporary societies, all the power of science has been expended on\nselfishness, egoism, acquisitiveness, ambition, exploitation, subjugation,\ndeceit, and guile.\n\nOne can regard the past two or three centuries as the age of the worship of\nscience and the flight from faith. Many thinkers came to believe that science\ncould solve all man's problems, but experience has proven the contrary. Today\nno thinker would deny man's need for some kind of faith-if not religious\nfaith, at least faith in something beyond science. Bertrand Russell, although\nhe had materialistic tendencies, admits “Work of which the motive is solely\npecuniary cannot have this value [of bringing a man into fruitful contact with\nthe outer world], but only work which embodies some kind of devotion, whether\nto persons, to things, or merely to a vision”.[10](epub.html#f_2240057c_10)\n\nToday materialists are driven to claim they are materialists in respect to\nphilosophy but idealists in respect to morals, that is, they are materialists\nin theory, but idealists in practice and aims.[11](epub.html#f_848d0dbf_11)\nThe question of how it is possible to be a materialist in theory and an\nidealist in practice is for the materialists themselves to answer.\n\nGeorge Sarton describes the inadequacy and incapacity of science to humanise\npersonal relationships and man's urgent need for the power of faith: “Science\nhas made gigantic progress in certain fields, but in others, e.g., in\npolitics, national and international, we are still fooling ourselves.” He\nadmits that the faith man needs is a religious faith. He says this of man's\nneed for the triad of art, religion, and science: “Art reveals beauty; it is\nthe joy of life. Religion means love; it is the music of life. Science means\ntruth and reason; it is the conscience of mankind. We need all of them - art\nand religion as well as science. Science is absolutely necessary but it is\nnever sufficient.” [12](epub.html#f_33280db5_12)\n\n## Effects and Advantages of Religious Faith\n\nWithout ideals, aspirations and fiath, man can neither live sane life nor\naccomplish anything useful or fruitful for humanity and human civilisation.\nOne lacking ideals and faith becomes eithr selfish, never emerging from his\nshell of private interests, or a wavering, bemused being who does not know his\nown duty in life, in moral and social questions. Man constantly confronts\nmoral and social questions, and must necessarily respond. If one is attached\nto a teaching, a belief, a faith, one’s duty is clear; but if no teaching or\nmethod has clarified one’s duty, one lives ever in a state of irresolution,\ndrawn sometimes this way, sometimes that, never in balance. So without any\ndoubt, one must attach oneself to a teaching and an ideal.\n\nOnly religious faith, however, can make man truly “faithful” – can make faith,\nbelief, and principle dominate selfishness and egoism, can create a kind of\ndevotion and surrender in the individual such that he does not doubt the least\npoint the teaching advances, and can render this belief something precious to\nhim, to the extent that life without it is hollow and meaningless and that he\nwill defend it with zeal and fervour.\n\nAptitudes to religious faith prompt man to struggle against his natural,\nindividual inclinations and sometimes to sacrifice his reputation and very\nbeing for the sake of faith.",

If we negate\none type of either under the pretext of the other, we are diverted from the\nteachings of Islam.\n\nThe saints of our religion including the holy Prophets, Imam Ali and all the\nother Imams were all strivers and migrants. From a spiritual point of view,\nthere are stages which cannot be passed except through these actions. A man\nwho has never entered the field of jihad cannot be called a mujahid and one\nwho has not migrated may not win the epithet of an emigrant.\n\nFrom the view of Islam, marriage is sacred in several practical ways (unlike\nChristianity where celibacy is considered to be sacred). What is the reason\nfor this? One of the reasons is in educating man's spirit. It is a kind of\nmaturity and perfection which is not obtainable except through marriage. If a\nman or a woman remains single to the end of his/her life, even if that life is\nspent in asceticism, devotion, prayer and in combat with vices, there is still\na kind of immaturity noticeable in each of them. That is why marriage is\nrecommended as a necessary tradition.\n\nThe factors which are efficacious in man's education are so in their proper\nspheres and none of them can take the place of another. Migration and jihad,\ntoo, are factors which cannot be replaced by any other factor. Nor can one\nkind of each factor take the place of the other kind.\n\nWhat is the duty of individuals under different conditions? For not all\nconditions are those of jihad and migration.\n\nThe Holy Prophet has seen to this and told us that the duty of a Muslim is to\nbe serious in his intention to migrate or enter jihad whenever conditions so\nnecessitate it. Thus a person who has never fought or never thought of\nfighting will in his death pass away in a kind of hypocrisy while those who\ncherish the intention to migrate or fight in a jihad under necessary\nconditions, may attain the rank. of emigrants and crusaders.\n\nThe Holy Quran says,\n\n_**\"Such believers as sit at home, unless they have an injury, are not the\nequals of those who struggle in the path of God with their possessions and\ntheir selves over the ones who sit at home, yet to each God has promised the\nreward most fair and God has preferred those who struggle over the ones who\nsit at home for the bounty of a mighty wage...\" (4:95)** _\n\nWhat God is telling us here is that the Muslims who are mujahids, fighters in\nthe path of God with their wealth and their lives and those who sit in their\nhomes (in disobedience to the Quran) merely on the pretext of 'those who are\nready to fight are enough,\" are not all equal. The Holy Quran does not\nreproach those who sit in their homes due to some excess like blindness or\nbeing lame or ill, whose mentalities and intentions are such that if they were\nnot handicapped in this way, they would be the first to rush to jihad in the\npath of God. Perhaps they too have the level of mujahids.\n\nWhen Ali, peace be upon him, returned from the Battle of Siffin, someone came\nto him and said, \"I wish my brother was with you in the battle.\" Ali said,\n\"What was his intention? Did he have an excuse or not? If he had no excuse for\nnot joining us, all the better that he did not come. But if his heart was with\nus though he could not join us for a reason, he may be considered to have been\nwith us.\" The man said, \"He did intend to join you.\" Ali, peace be upon him,\nsaid, \"Then not only was your brother with us but even those who are still in\nthe wombs of their mothers or in the loins of their fathers may be considered\nas having joined us.\"\n\nWhat is meant by 'waiting for the advent?' Some people suppose it to mean\nwaiting for the twelfth Imam to reappear one day with his three hundred and\nthirteen special companions and other followers to destroy the enemies of\nIslam, to establish peace and prosperity and perfect freedom, for us to enjoy.\nWhat is really meant by waiting for relief (through the advent of the Imam\nMahdi) is the hope of joining Imam Mahdi on his reappearance in the holy war\nand perhaps even attaining martyrdom. That is the hearty wish of every true\nMuslim and striver.",

You have heard that it is said that for\nsuch and such a person \"takfir\" is made. By saying this word, is kufr\ninfidelity, disbelief created in him?

All of you pay ta’zim\n(respect) to Imam. Do you (by so doing) create ‘azamah (greatness) in him or\ndo you perceive his ‘azamah (greatness)?

Even if we have a\nclassless society in Islam and it is also desirable, it does not concern as\nAt-Tawhid as a principle of faith of Islam, and it is interesting to note that\nin the Holy Qur’an, the word At-Tawhid and its derivatives are not found at\nall and this great Islamic principle has appeared in the Holy Qur’an in other\nwordings. The Holy Qur’an says:\n\n> وَإِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ..\n\n_**“And your God is one God! There is no god but He… (2:163).”** _\n\nYour God is One and Only God and He has no partner, either inside or outside\nHis Being.\n\nThe discussion is about knowing Allah, not the society, so the creation or\nnon-creation of oneness of class cannot he meant here.\n\nAnyhow, this was one of the greatest intellectual distortions which were made\ntowards this ideological principle of Islam, and sometimes it was even said:\n\"Basically God in Islam is a moral concept and is not propounded as a true and\nreal being.\" Sometimes it was said: \"God and the hereafter do not have\nphilosophical concept, rather utter goodness, absolute perfection, forgoing\nworldly pleasures and profits and in one word moral ideal is the very God and\nHe has no external existence either (God forbid) and that we should pursue\nthese absolute words and try to become perfect and that worshipping God means\njust this.\"\n\n## Wrong Imaginations concerning the Meaning of At-Tawhid\n\nSome others believed that just giving the world a movement by Allah and so to\nsay His giving the world a start suffices for the world wheel to rotate till\neternity, without being in any need of Allah again.

Some groups or Islamic philosophers have also had such\ninclinations arid it is regrettable that such a deviational way or thinking\nhas been from those who also believed in the Only Allah, let alone the\natheists and the polytheists.\n\nSuch way of thinking, namely, to think that Allah’s work is just the creation\nof this world, or at most inflicting the first blow or the primary\nstimulation, is totally rejected in Islam.",

      "text": "Here are some facts extracted from the provided text:\n\nQur'an -> Defines -> Islam\n\nOf course, man does not reach his purpose in every deed. In addition to the\nexistence of favourable external factors, man's success is dependent on the\nsoundness of perception and its power of distinction, as well as the sound\nrecognition of how to eliminate the shortcoming, to employ his faculties and\nto use external factors.\n\nAt times, man's consideration of his needs takes place naturally and by body\nreactions; for instance, thirst and hunger. At other times, it takes place\nupon contact with the external world; for example, sensing danger would lead\n(man) to escape or to prepare to defend himself or seeing a pitiful scene\nwould touch a person of noble sentiments into suffering from the deprivation\nof others and being stirred into helping them.\n\nIn the first case, association of external factors would at times, awaken a\nslumbering desire as already discussed. External factors likewise, could be\neffective in awakening innate desires and absolute psychological drives, as\nthe call of the prophets awakens theism. Seeing and hearing their signs would\nalso produce the same effect.\n\nIf at a single moment, just one instinct and desire exists in the soul, man\nimmediately sets to satisfy it. In case the situation is favourable and in\ncase there are no external barriers, man carries out the appropriate deed. But\nif there are various desires and if all of them cannot be satisfied at once,\nthey will naturally clash with one another.\n\nWhichever has greater attraction will draw attention to itself and will reach\nfulfillment, as some children prefer to play rather than to eat, as a hungry\nmother gives her food to her child, as a student prefers studying, as a devout\nman prefers to engage in worship rather than to sleep and as a combatant\nsoldier prefers sacrifice in the way of Allah (SWT) to the comfort of himself\nand his family. In such cases, the value of man will become evident and his\ndormant aptitudes will flourish. And (either) prosperity or adversity will\nreach materialization. Principally this is the philosophy of the creation of\nman in a world of clashes and conflicts as repeatedly pointed out.\n\nNow the question arises as to whether man should be an observer of the clash\nof desires and to pursue a desire when it becomes dominant due to natural or\nsocial factors or should assume a decisive and determining role with his\nmental and voluntary activities and even at times, abstain from satisfying his\npowerful natural demands? In the first case, man will submit to blind\ninstincts and will be like a straw at the mercy of storm or flood. In fact, he\nwill give up humanity and in other words, he will render meaningless the\nspecial human faculties. The Qur'an interprets this as \"heedlessness\", a\nheedlessness which makes man less than animals and puts him in worse errors:\n\n> “أُولَٰئِكَ كَالْأَنْعَامِ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ\n> الْغَافِلُونَ”\n\n_**“They are as cattle, nay, they are in worse errors; these are the heedless\nones ([7:179](/printepub/book/export/html/28857#quran_ref_107236)).”** _\n\nIn the second case, another issue is raised: What is the criterion with which\nman should prefer some of his desires to others? As this question embraces\nreligion itself, it must be answered irrespective of means that are taken for\ngranted.\n\nThis question could be answered in three forms:\n\n**Firstly,** on the basis of the innate desire to prefer what is most\nenjoyable, one would evaluate the affairs in relation to the pleasure they\nprovide. When the affairs clash, one would choose the most pleasurable one. Of\ncourse in this evaluation, one must not set an instantaneous pleasure as a\ncriterion because an affair with instantaneous pleasure might bring about\ngreat sufferings in the future. In addition we might not have experienced\npleasure of some affairs so as to be able to compare them with other matters.\nThus the sound means to determine what is most enjoyable is to recognize the\nessence of pleasure and its criterion and to find out through a rational\nanalysis, which pleasure is more valuable and enduring.",

But here\nwe shall try to review briefly the most important points assured that our\nreaders who take their lives seriously will follow this journey through\nfurther studying and reflection.\n\nBefore anything we should pay attention to two points:\n\nA) We should observe our goal constantly during our lives, day and night;\notherwise we cannot utilise our power for our aim and the ordinary affairs\nwill capture our attention and gradually it may make us doubtful about the\nnecessity of following that aim. It is all too common for human beings who are\nnot successful in their pre-decided program to try to get rid of their\ndifficulties through a denial of that program.\n\nB) We should pray and ask Allah seriously to help and save us. We cannot\ncontinue this spiritual journey without His special help. Yes, with His help\nthere will be no obstacle and nothing can stop us. So in the relationship with\nAllah we should not feel self-sufficient, because we are completely and\nabsolutely dependent on Him. However in the relationship with others we should\ntrust ourselves and rely on our powers without allowing despair to capture our\nhearts. The Prophet (S) who was the bravest man and stood against all enemies\nand was able to change the world said:\n\n> إِلٰهِي لا تكلنى الى نفسى طرفة عينٍ ابداً\n\n“O My God! Do not ever leave me by myself even for an\ninstant.”[1](epub.html#f_d04c4529_1)\n\nLet's listen to Imam al-Sajjad (‘a) when he asks Allah for help:\n\n> سُبْحانَكَ ما أَضْيَقَ الطُّرُقَ عَلىٰ مَنْ لَمْ تَكُنْ دَلِيلَهُ! وَما\n> أَوْضَحَ الْحَقَّ عِنْدَ مَنْ هَدَيْتَهُ سَبِيلَهُ!",

      "text": "Here are some facts extracted from the provided text:\n\nMulla Sadra -> Invalidated -> Principle of Constancy\n\nBut this is not true. One is learned, another is ignorant; one is virtuous,\nanother is impure; one is tyrannical, another is oppressed; one is benevolent,\nanother is malevolent. Should we consider them all the same from a\nhumanitarian point of view, irrespective of their knowledge, faith, chastity\nand benevolence or vice versa?\n\nIf we say so, we are betraying humanity. Let me give an example. Both A and B\nare human beings who are biologically similar. If you dislike one of them, it\nhas nothing to do with his blood group. But if you are humanitarian, you\ncannot be indifferent to both of them and claim that they are equally human;\nfor then both should be equally liked, or both equally disliked.\n\nBut this is not so since the human being's basic difference with animals is\nthat the human being has more potentiality than animals and less actuality.\nWhat does that mean? A horse on its birth possesses all the peculiarities that\na horse should have and if it has less than that, it can gain it by practice.\nBut a human being has potential only at birth. lt is not known what he or she\nwill be in the future. The shape is human hut that person may, in reality,\nbecome a wolf or a sheep or a human being.\n\nMulla Sadra, the great Iranian Islamic philosopher, in pointing out the error\nof people in thinking human beings equal in everything, says that there are as\nmany kinds of individuals as there are individuals. He is, of courses\nregarding the human being philosophically, not biologically. A biologist pays\nattention to human organs and limbs, while a philosopher concentrates on the\nhuman being's qualities and thus he cannot believe that human beings are all\nof the same kind. That is why human values are potential. Some attain the\nheight of humanity while others fail to do so. As Hadrat Ali says, \"The shape\nis humans but the mind may be a beast.\" Not all individuals have an interior\nproportionate to their exterior.\n\nAs I said before, to a great extent, the world is returning, once again to the\nschool of humanity, meaning that philosophies of humanity have appeared; and\nthe strangest of them all is the creed of humanity which Auguste Compte\noriginated in the middle of the 19th century.\n\nThis man wavered between his intelligence and mind on the one hand and his\nheart and conscience on the other and came to the conclusion that the human\nbeing needed a creed, the absence of which results in all kinds of social\ncorruption. According to him, past religion (Catholicism) is not adequate\nenough for modern mankind. He describes three stages of religion; The divine\nsupernatural stage, the philosophical reasoning stage and the scientific\npositive stage.\n\nHe said that Catholicism belonged to the human being's supernatural thinking\nand this is not acceptable to the person of the scientific age. His invented\nreligion however, lacked an occult root, but he accepted all the traditions\nand rites which existed before, and even proposed having priests in this new\ncreed, presenting himself as its prophet, but a prophet without a god. They\nsay about him that he got his rites from Catholicism and he was criticized for\nthis since he disbelieved that religion but imitated and adopted its\nceremonies and traditions. He was right in one thing, that the human being\nneeds worship and devotion as well as the performance of a number of rites.\n\nHe seems to have found a large number of followers in Europe and America and\nhis house has become a center of pilgrimage for them. According to some Arabic\nbooks, he had fallen in love with a lady whose husband had been condemned to\nlife imprisonment, but she died before he could win her and consequently he\nturned away frown the world of the intellect to the world of sentiments and\neventually started his creed of humanity. This lady-love is considered by his\nfollowers as holy as Mary, the mother of Christ. But this school of humanity\nunderwent a number of changes which gave it its present form.\n\nOne of the questions concerning the human being is freedom and responsibility.\nIs the human being really free and independent or does it have a\nresponsibility and a mission to perform? According to the Quran, the human\nbeing is faced with no compulsion before God. On the contrary, the human being\nis created a free being with a fixed responsibility and mission.",

      "text": "Here are some facts extracted from the provided text:\n\nHUMAN BEINGS -> RESPONSIBILITY -> ANIMALS\nQUR’AN -> GUIDANCE -> HUMAN BEINGS\n\nThe Qur’an says,\n\n_**“And He has subjected to you, as from Him, all that is in the heavens and\non earth: Behold, in that are Signs indeed for those who reflect.”\n([45:13](/printepub/book/export/html/119608#quran_ref_165955)).** _\n\n_**“It is He Who hath created for you all things that are on earth…”\n([2:29](/printepub/book/export/html/119608#quran_ref_165956)).** _\n\nHowever, human beings must make use of nature, and indeed every other gift and\nblessing, in a responsible way,\n\n_**“Then on that day you shall most certainly be questioned about the\nblessings.” ([102:8](/printepub/book/export/html/119608#quran_ref_165957)).**\n_\n\nTherefore, everything in the world that is at the disposal of human beings is\nboth a gift and a trust. If they were only trusts, humans would not have\npermission to use them. Since they are gifts of God, they can be used but\ncannot be wasted or used extravagantly as it is the case with any trust.\n\n_**“And He it is Who produces gardens (of vine), trellised and untrellised,\nand palms and seed- produce of which the fruits are of various sorts, and\nolives and pomegranates, like** _ _****_ _**and unlike; eat of its fruit when\nit bears fruit, and pay the due of it on the day of its reaping, and do not\nact extravagantly; surely He does not love the extravagant.”\n([6:141](/printepub/book/export/html/119608#quran_ref_165958)).** _\n\n_**“O Children of Adam! Wear your beautiful apparel at every time and place of\nprayer: eat and drink: But waste not by excess, for God does not love the\nextravagant.” ([7:31](/printepub/book/export/html/119608#quran_ref_165959)).**\n_\n\nIn addition to this, the Qur’an makes it clear that it is a human\nresponsibility to make efforts to improve the conditions of the globe as much\nas possible:\n\n_**“He brought you forth from the earth and has asked you to improve it,\ntherefore ask forgiveness of Him, then turn to Him; surely my Lord is Nigh,\nAnswering.” ([11:61](/printepub/book/export/html/119608#quran_ref_165960)).**\n_\n\nTherefore, one must be very careful about the way they treat nature and the\nenvironment. As an example, some of the human moral and legal responsibilities\nwith respect to animals can be observed. In Islamic hadiths it can be found\nthat the unjustified killing of animals or negligence towards their lives is\nvery severely treated. For example, Imam Sadiq informed those with him about\nthe divine punishment of a woman who had fastened a cat with a rope so that\nthe cat could not move and died out of thirst.[31](epub.html#f_379b15da_31)\n\nA predominant scholar, ‘Allamah Mohammad Taqi Ja‘fari concludes his discussion\nabout animals in this way:\n\n“Consideration of whole sources of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) leads to the\nconclusion that animals must not be killed unless there is a legal permission\n(by God) like benefiting from them or being safe from their harm. There are\nadequate reasons for prohibiting hunting animals for fun and one can argue\nfrom them for prohibition of killing animals without having a permitting\ncause.”[32](epub.html#f_dadf2b24_32)\n\nThe above idea is part of a broader Islamic perspective on animal life.\nAccording to Islam, there are many rights for animals that must be observed.\nConsideration of those rights shows that not only should their lives be\nprotected, but the quality of their life must also be observed. For example,\nanimals must not be bothered by forcing them to carry heavy goods or to move\nfaster than they tolerate. Neither should animals be cursed or harassed.  \nIt is reported that Imam Ali said:\n\n“Whoever curses an animal he himself will be cursed by\nGod.”[33](epub.html#f_bc5bdef7_33)\n\n  * [1.](epub.html#fref_03f840e8_1) Nahj al-Balaghah, Sermon 219.\n  * [2.",

The\nordainment of _khums_[73](epub.html#f_5524309e_73) and _zak_ _a_\n_t_[74](epub.html#f_0bd2726b_74) accordingly was meant to lessen the class\ngaps, but nowadays the issue of “public equality” is raised while private\nownership has been undermined. As such, _khums_ and _zak_ _a_ _t_ are no more\napplicable.\n\nMany of those who raise these issues are outwardly not against Islam. Instead,\nthey imagine that such laws of Islam were meant for 14 centuries ago. Today,\nman can formulate laws for himself as the human intellect has developed and is\nno longer in need of following revealed instructions!\n\nThus, the objection based on the benefit of using non-Arabic languages in\nsupplications on the ground of not understanding Arabic, finally ends up in\ntreating the revelation and heavenly laws as antiquated. The religion is\nrevealed by God and has given none of His servants the right to interfere in\nit:\n\n> ﴿ إِنِ الْحُكْمُ إِلا لِلَّهِ ﴾\n\n“Judgment belongs only to Allah.”[75](epub.html#f_afaeb3eb_75)\n\n> ﴿ وَمَنْ لَمْ يَحْكُمْ بِما أَنْزَلَ اللّهُ فَأُولئِكَ هُمُ الْكافِرُونَ ﴾\n\n_****_ _**“Those who do not judge by what Allah has sent down—it is they who\nare the faithless.”** _ [76](epub.html#f_86e77ef1_76)\n\nThe Sabbathians who were among the Israelites were living by the seaside and\ntheir main occupation was fishing. A commandment from God was revealed for\nthem not to go fishing on Saturdays and devote it only to the worship of God.\nGod wished to test them. Fish used to increase on Saturdays as compared to the\nrest of the week. In a bid to catch more fish and not inflict harm to their\neconomy, they invented crafty methods through which the fish got trapped. They\nmade ponds near the seashore. On Saturdays they would connect these ponds to\nthe sea so that the fish would rush towards them, and then close the\nconnections. The following day, they would catch the fish stranded in the\nponds. Outwardly, there was nothing wrong with this practice and it had no\nconflict with the religious law for they were forbidden to catch fish on the\nSabbath and not to fill ponds with fish. It was a trick to circumvent the\nreligious injunctions as our tricks to circumvent God’s decrees with our false\njustifications for the practice of usury [_rib_ _a’_]. Most probably, if we\nwere with them, we would have accepted the same practice, but because of this\nact of violation God transformed those people into apes and annihilated them\nshortly afterwards.\n\nThis is neither fiction nor part of the distorted [_ta_ _h_ _r_ _i_ _f_] parts\nof the Torah [_tawr_ _a_ _t_] and the Evangel [_inj_ _i_ _l_], but mentioned\nin the Qur’an.[77](epub.html#f_349acd3e_77)\n\nThose who are God-wary must take lessons from these stories. They must not\nplay with the religion of God and His laws and practice “religious fraud”. The\nreligion is that which God has commanded and its laws are exactly those\nmentioned by the Apostle (S) and the Imams (_‘a_).\n\nApproaching religious laws with fraud will invite calamities to descend upon\nus. Playing with the religion of God will lead to the annihilation of the\nplayers. In any case, it is necessary to perform the prayers, read the Qur’an\nand make supplications.",

Relationship_description: God is described as the unlimited, enduring reality that supports all beings, which are limited, relative, and conditional. Without God, the edifice of existence could not subsist. -> BEINGS\n\n### Purpose of creation according to the Qur’an\n\nIn the Holy Qur’an, different expressions are used to describe the purpose\nbehind the creation of man. In a certain verse, it is stated that he is\ncreated for test and trial:\n\n> ﴿ الَّذِي خَلَقَ الْمَوْتَ وَالْحَيَاةَ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ\n> عَمَلاً ﴾\n\n_**“He created death and life that He may test you [to see] which of you is\nbest in conduct.”** _ [17](epub.html#f_23061f5d_17)\n\nIn another verse, worship of God is mentioned as the purpose behind his\ncreation:\n\n> ﴿ وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلاَّ لِيَعْبُدُونِ ﴾\n\n_**“I did not create the jinn and humans except that they may worship Me.”** _\n[18](epub.html#f_3e65d824_18)\n\nIn yet another verse, it is stated that man is created so that he may enjoy\nthe divine favor and attain nearness to God:\n\n> ﴿ إِلاَّ مَنْ رَحِمَ رَبُّكَ وَلِذٰلِك خَلََقَهُم ﴾\n\n_**“** _ _**Except those on whom your Lord has mercy—and that is why He\ncreated them.”** _ [19](epub.html#f_2c21e772_19)\n\nOutwardly, theses verses are inconsistent with one another but in reality each\nof them refers to a certain level of a single truth. In other words, they\nallude to the short-term, middle-term and ultimate objectives. The ultimate\nobjective is proximity to God. Man has been given freedom and freewill to\nworship and serve God and attain nearness to Him. If man is compelled to tread\nthe right path, his movement cannot be treated as a movement for perfection.\nIn this regard, the Holy Qur’an states:\n\n> ﴿ وَعَلَى اللَّهِ قَصْدُ السَّبِيلِ وَمِنْهَا جَائِرٌ وَلَوْ شَاءَ\n> لَهَدَاكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ ﴾\n\n_**“With Allah rests guidance to the straight path, and some of them are\ndevious, and had He wished, He would have guided you all.”** _\n[20](epub.html#f_48927530_20)\n\nGod has shown many paths to man so that he can freely choose and tread his\npath to perfection. By successfully passing this test of choosing the right\npath, one stage in his way to perfection is passed. In order to be accepted by\nGod, he must take a step towards the next stages to perfection and strive to\nmake his life totally dedicated to God. Everything belongs to Him and we are\nHis servants and a servant is not worthy of anything but servitude. Worldly\nneeds and material pleasures are not the ultimate objective of man. He must\ndeal with them only to the extent necessary and all his attention must focus\non his servitude to God. Through his worship and servitude to God, he will\nattain nearness to God.\n\nWorship [_‘ib_ _a_ _dah_] is a general concept which is not confined to\nprayers and fasting. Every good work done for the sake of God is considered an\nact of worship. Even the sleep of a fasting person during the month of\nRamadhan is an act of worship because it gives him an opportunity to rest so\nthat he can engage in the night vigil and supererogatory prayers.\n\n> وَأغْنِنِي وَوَسِّعْ عَلَيَّ فِي رِزْقِكَ وَلا تَفْتِنِّي بِالَّنَظِر.",

In facing undesirable\nevents, people are put on trial with the aim of knowing their reaction. Some\ntrials are related to the first stage of faith to see whether a person\nobserves the divine laws or not in the face of pressing circumstances. A\nhigher level is exclusive for the outstanding servants of Allah with the aim\nof knowing whether they will endure difficulties or complain about them. This\nis the station of “patience” [_s_ _abr_]. The station higher than the station\nof patience is that of “contentment” [_ri_ _dha’_]. That is, the people of\ncontentment endure pain, suffering and affliction and are contented with them\nat the same time. Their hearts do not have any complaint or grudge because\nthese events emanate from God. This is the highest stage of faith in which man\nis completely contented with the decrees of God, firmly believing that these\ndecrees are based on Divine wisdom. Thus, during the Night of Ascension, God\nsaid to His Apostle (S): “The most beloved acts for Me are trust (in God)\n[_tawakkal_] and (then) ‘contentment’ [_ri_ _dha_ _yah_] with what I have\ndecreed.”[89](epub.html#f_9b804b23_89)\n\nOf course, this does not mean that man must not work anymore. In fact, his\nendeavor is considered one of the elements of Divine decree. It means that we\nmust be contented with whatever happens and bear in mind that there is wisdom\nbehind it.\n\nGod addressed Prophet Musa, thus:\n\n> يَا مُوسىٰ مَا خَلَقْتُ خَلْقاً أَحَبَّ إِلَىَّ مِنْ عَبْدِي الْمُؤْمِنْ\n> وَإِنِّي إنَّمَا ابْتَلَيْتُهُ لِمَا هُوَ خَيْرٌ لَهُ.\n\n“O Musa! No creature is more beloved to Me than My faithful servant. Verily,\nif I send him an affliction it is good for him.”[90](epub.html#f_80d1c8c4_90)\n\nThe mother who gives unpleasant and bitter medicines to her sick child\nevidently loves her child, and she does so not on account of animosity or\nhostility but out of love and affection. The same is true in the case of God.\n\nWe have many traditions [_riw_ _a_ _y_ _a_ _t_] where it is mentioned that\nsometimes God sees in poverty what is good for His servant and that religious\naffair will not be set right except through poverty and indigence. Out of His\nlove for this servant, God makes him poor. Sometimes, the faith of a servant\nwill not be preserved except through prosperity. So God makes him rich. There\nare also instances when poverty and prosperity are means of testing His\nservants.[91](epub.html#f_1bc7fd04_91)\n\nIt must be emphasized again that man must not surrender and give up working,\nbut say: “O God, give to me whatever is good for me!” In fact, to perform\none’s obligations is one story and to entrust the affairs to God and be\ncontented with His decree is another.\n\nIn any case, man must be contented with what God has apportioned for him—be it\nlittle or plenty. This contentment has good effects both in this world and in\nthe hereafter. In this world, he will find peace of mind and tranquility of\nthe heart. In the hereafter, he will attain the station of the people of\ncontentment.\n\nRegrettably, because of the weakness of faith, most people are not contented\nwith what God has given them and complain about it. As such, they do not enjoy\npeace of mind and are always unhappy.",

For example, in _Du‘_ _a_ _’\nKumayl_ which is a noble and valuable supplication, Ḥadhrat ‘Ali (_‘a_) said\nwhile addressing God:\n\n> فَهَبْني يا إلـهي وَسَيِّدِي وَمَوْلايَ وَرَبّي صَبَرْتُ عَلى عَذابِكَ،\n> فَكَيْفَ اَصْبِرُ عَلى فِراقِكَ، وَهَبْني صَبَرْتُ عَلى حَرِّ نارِكَ،\n> فَكَيْفَ اَصْبِرُ عَنِ النَّظَرِ إلى كَرامَتِكَ.\n\n“Then suppose, my Allah, my Master, my Protector and my Lord, that I am able\nto endure Your chastisement, how can I endure separation from You? And suppose\nthat I am able to endure the heat of Your fire, how can I endure not gazing\nupon Your Generosity?”\n\nThese statements are only suitable to the accomplished _awliy_ _a_ _’_ of\nAllah, and everyone cannot claim them. Only he who knows what a mystical union\n[_wa_ _s_ _l_] and separation [_fir_ _a_ _q_] is can express such feelings.\nBut he who is ignorant of a union has no right to say that he is suffering\nfrom separation from God. Only he who knows what union is and for whom it is\ndesirable suffers from separation. So long as we do not know God nor grasp His\nperfection, we will never feel pain on being separated from Him. So, we cannot\nsay that we can endure His punishment but not separation from Him?\n\nHow can he who cries loudly, (that borders on _kufr_)__ for suffering from a\ncommon headache or toothache, which is not even one-millionth of the pain of\nthe chastisement in the hereafter, ever claim that he can endure the torment\nof the hellfire but not separation from God?! What do we know of the mystical\nunion with God that we can endure the hellish punishment?\n\nExpression of such points is suitable only to personalities such as the\nCommander of the Faithful (_‘a_). For us to express them is so far from\nreality. Yet, such points can be noticed in many transmitted supplications. If\nwe want to utter these statements with the intention of showing our inner\nstate and condition, it is a lie and telling a lie to God is far worse than\nlying to His creatures. Therefore, in such supplications we must have the\nintention of narrating [_h_ _ik_ _a_ _yah_]. For instance, with the intention\nof narrating, we have to quote what Ḥadhrat ‘Ali (_‘a_) uttered in\nsupplication, and not with the intention of expressing it by ourselves because\nit is unbecoming of us. We should also have the intention of praying to God to\ngrant us the necessary gnosis by which we deserve to utter such statements.\n\n## Need to reflect on religious laws and repercussions of disrespectful acts\n\nSupplication means asking God for something and talking to Him. Man knows the\nthing he wants and understands what he talks about. Some people have this\nwrong notion that reading the transmitted supplications brings no benefit to\nthose who cannot understand them because they do not understand what they are\nreciting and asking God for; they are just uttering some words. It is better\nfor them not to read them, but talk to God in their respective languages\naccording to their cognition of Him. This view has also been raised against\nthe recital of the Qur’an. They assert that reading the Qur’an brings no\nbenefit to those who cannot understand its meaning and wastes their precious\ntime!",

Questions of experimental science have a time-bound value and may grow\nobsolescent at any moment. A wisdom based on experiment is naturally\nprecarious and so does not meet a basic human need, the need for certainty.\nCertainty arises in questions having mathematical abstraction or philosophical\nabstraction, and the meanings of mathematical and philosophical abstractions\ncan be clarified only by philosophy.\n\nThere remain deductive wisdom and experiential wisdom. The questions discussed\nin the following sections should elucidate these two wisdoms and spell out\ntheir value.\n\n### Problems in Philosophy\n\n#### Being\n\nPhilosophical questions pivot on being. That which is to philosophy what the\nbody is to medicine, number is to mathematics, or quantify is to geometry is\nbeing _qua_ being. It is the subject of philosophy and all philosophical\ntopics turn on it. In other words, philosophy has for its subject existence.\n\nSeveral kinds of questions turn on being. One is questions pertaining to\nbeing, or existence, and its opposites in the two respective senses: nonbeing\nand essence (_mahiya_).[14](epub.html#f_749da759_14) There is nothing but\nbeing in the objective world. Being has no opposite outside the mind. But the\nconceptualising mind of man has formed two concepts vis-a-vis being or\nexistence: nonbeing and essence (of course, essences). A range of\nphilosophical questions, especially in sublime wisdom, pertains to existence\nand essence, and another range pertains to being and nonbeing.\n\nA second group of questions pertains to divisions of being. Being in its turn\nhas divisions that are regarded as amounting to species of being; in other\nwords, being is divisible (for instance, into the objective and the\nsubjective, the necessary and the possible, the eternal and the created in\ntime, the stable and the changing, the singular and the plural, the potential\nand the act, and the substance and the accident). Of course, these are the\nprimary divisions of being, that is, the divisions that enter into being by\nvirtue of the fact that it is being.\n\nTo illustrate, divisions into black and white, large and small, equal and\nunequal, odd and even, or long and short are divisions not in being _qua_\nbeing but in being _qua_ body or in being _qua_ quantifiable. Corporeality in\nbeing corporeality, or quantity in being quantity, admits of such division.\nHowever, division into singular and plural, or division into necessary and\npossible, is division of being _qua_ being.\n\nClose research has been done in philosophy as to the criteria for these\ndivisions, what distinguishes the divisions of being _qua_ being from other\ndivisions. Some philosophers have regarded certain divisions as applying to\nbody _qua_ body and thus falling outside the scope of first philosophy, but\nother philosophers for various reasons have regarded these divisions as\napplying to being _qua_ being and thus falling under this same domain.\n\nA third group of questions pertains to the universal laws governing being,\nsuch as causality, the correspondence of cause and effect, the necessity\ngoverning the system of cause and effect, and priority versus synchronism\namong the levels of being.\n\nA fourth group of questions pertains to demonstration of the planes of being\nor worlds of being. Being has particular planes or worlds. The _hukama'_ of\nIslam believe that there are four general worlds or four emergences\n(_nash'a_):\n\n1\\. The world of nature, or the _nasut_\n\n2\\. The world of ideas, or the _malakut_\n\n3\\. The world of [separate] intelligences, or the _jabarut_\n\n4\\. The world of divinity, or the _lahut_\n\nThe world of _nasut_ is the world of matter, motion, and space-time. It is the\nworld of nature and sense objects, this world. The world of [Platonic] ideas\n[similitudes], or the _malakut_ , is a world superior to nature, having forms\nand dimensions, but lacking motion, time, and change.\n\nThe world of _jabarut_ is the world of the [separate] intelligences or the\nworld of the [abstract] idea (_ma'na_), free of forms and images and thus\nsuperior to the world of _malakut_.",

In a certain verse, it is stated that he is\ncreated for test and trial:\n\n> ﴿ الَّذِي خَلَقَ الْمَوْتَ وَالْحَيَاةَ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ\n> عَمَلاً ﴾\n\n_**“He created death and life that He may test you [to see] which of you is\nbest in conduct.”** _ [17](epub.html#f_23061f5d_17)\n\nIn another verse, worship of God is mentioned as the purpose behind his\ncreation:\n\n> ﴿ وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلاَّ لِيَعْبُدُونِ ﴾\n\n_**“I did not create the jinn and humans except that they may worship Me.”** _\n[18](epub.html#f_3e65d824_18)\n\nIn yet another verse, it is stated that man is created so that he may enjoy\nthe divine favor and attain nearness to God:\n\n> ﴿ إِلاَّ مَنْ رَحِمَ رَبُّكَ وَلِذٰلِك خَلََقَهُم ﴾\n\n_**“** _ _**Except those on whom your Lord has mercy—and that is why He\ncreated them.”** _ [19](epub.html#f_2c21e772_19)\n\nOutwardly, theses verses are inconsistent with one another but in reality each\nof them refers to a certain level of a single truth. In other words, they\nallude to the short-term, middle-term and ultimate objectives. The ultimate\nobjective is proximity to God. Man has been given freedom and freewill to\nworship and serve God and attain nearness to Him. If man is compelled to tread\nthe right path, his movement cannot be treated as a movement for perfection.\nIn this regard, the Holy Qur’an states:\n\n> ﴿ وَعَلَى اللَّهِ قَصْدُ السَّبِيلِ وَمِنْهَا جَائِرٌ وَلَوْ شَاءَ\n> لَهَدَاكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ ﴾\n\n_**“With Allah rests guidance to the straight path, and some of them are\ndevious, and had He wished, He would have guided you all.”** _\n[20](epub.html#f_48927530_20)\n\nGod has shown many paths to man so that he can freely choose and tread his\npath to perfection. By successfully passing this test of choosing the right\npath, one stage in his way to perfection is passed. In order to be accepted by\nGod, he must take a step towards the next stages to perfection and strive to\nmake his life totally dedicated to God. Everything belongs to Him and we are\nHis servants and a servant is not worthy of anything but servitude. Worldly\nneeds and material pleasures are not the ultimate objective of man. He must\ndeal with them only to the extent necessary and all his attention must focus\non his servitude to God. Through his worship and servitude to God, he will\nattain nearness to God.\n\nWorship [_‘ib_ _a_ _dah_] is a general concept which is not confined to\nprayers and fasting. Every good work done for the sake of God is considered an\nact of worship. Even the sleep of a fasting person during the month of\nRamadhan is an act of worship because it gives him an opportunity to rest so\nthat he can engage in the night vigil and supererogatory prayers.\n\n> وَأغْنِنِي وَوَسِّعْ عَلَيَّ فِي رِزْقِكَ وَلا تَفْتِنِّي بِالَّنَظِر.",

In facing undesirable\nevents, people are put on trial with the aim of knowing their reaction. Some\ntrials are related to the first stage of faith to see whether a person\nobserves the divine laws or not in the face of pressing circumstances. A\nhigher level is exclusive for the outstanding servants of Allah with the aim\nof knowing whether they will endure difficulties or complain about them. This\nis the station of “patience” [_s_ _abr_]. The station higher than the station\nof patience is that of “contentment” [_ri_ _dha’_]. That is, the people of\ncontentment endure pain, suffering and affliction and are contented with them\nat the same time. Their hearts do not have any complaint or grudge because\nthese events emanate from God. This is the highest stage of faith in which man\nis completely contented with the decrees of God, firmly believing that these\ndecrees are based on Divine wisdom. Thus, during the Night of Ascension, God\nsaid to His Apostle (S): “The most beloved acts for Me are trust (in God)\n[_tawakkal_] and (then) ‘contentment’ [_ri_ _dha_ _yah_] with what I have\ndecreed.”[89](epub.html#f_9b804b23_89)\n\nOf course, this does not mean that man must not work anymore. In fact, his\nendeavor is considered one of the elements of Divine decree. It means that we\nmust be contented with whatever happens and bear in mind that there is wisdom\nbehind it.\n\nGod addressed Prophet Musa, thus:\n\n> يَا مُوسىٰ مَا خَلَقْتُ خَلْقاً أَحَبَّ إِلَىَّ مِنْ عَبْدِي الْمُؤْمِنْ\n> وَإِنِّي إنَّمَا ابْتَلَيْتُهُ لِمَا هُوَ خَيْرٌ لَهُ.\n\n“O Musa! No creature is more beloved to Me than My faithful servant. Verily,\nif I send him an affliction it is good for him.”[90](epub.html#f_80d1c8c4_90)\n\nThe mother who gives unpleasant and bitter medicines to her sick child\nevidently loves her child, and she does so not on account of animosity or\nhostility but out of love and affection. The same is true in the case of God.\n\nWe have many traditions [_riw_ _a_ _y_ _a_ _t_] where it is mentioned that\nsometimes God sees in poverty what is good for His servant and that religious\naffair will not be set right except through poverty and indigence. Out of His\nlove for this servant, God makes him poor. Sometimes, the faith of a servant\nwill not be preserved except through prosperity. So God makes him rich. There\nare also instances when poverty and prosperity are means of testing His\nservants.[91](epub.html#f_1bc7fd04_91)\n\nIt must be emphasized again that man must not surrender and give up working,\nbut say: “O God, give to me whatever is good for me!” In fact, to perform\none’s obligations is one story and to entrust the affairs to God and be\ncontented with His decree is another.\n\nIn any case, man must be contented with what God has apportioned for him—be it\nlittle or plenty. This contentment has good effects both in this world and in\nthe hereafter. In this world, he will find peace of mind and tranquility of\nthe heart. In the hereafter, he will attain the station of the people of\ncontentment.\n\nRegrettably, because of the weakness of faith, most people are not contented\nwith what God has given them and complain about it. As such, they do not enjoy\npeace of mind and are always unhappy.",

      "text": "Here are some facts extracted from the provided text:\n\nPIERRE ROUSSEAU -> Relation: Critique -> GOD\n\nHis conception, and that of all scientists who think along the same\nlines, is, according to firm and indubitable philosophical demonstrations,\nimpossible and absurd; such a thing never has occurred and never can occur.\nThat conception of the creation rests on wild, haphazard surmise. God's\ncreation does not take place except through specific and definite norms,\nwhether or not they are known to us.\n\nYou may suppose that Pierre Rousseau and others speak for science, propounding\nand explaining what science has shown them, and that my objections amount to\nobjections to the progress of science. What I have sought to show in these\nexamples is that the hypotheses so expressed do not rest on concrete\nobservations and objective experiments. The trend of scientific experiment can\nbe otherwise explained and interpreted, but the particular conception\nscientists have of the creation and the particular sort of philosophy that\nholds sway over their minds have resulted in the above-named questions being\naddressed as they have throughout the history of science. Despite what the\ntitle of his book suggests, what Rousseau addresses is not just the history of\nscience and of empirical observation, but a hybrid history of science and\nEuropean philosophy.\n\nThe most tragicomic aspects of this situation pertain not to the history of\nthe modern sciences, but to that of philosophical thought in Europe. European\nscientists conceive of the creation in terms of a form of the Jewish\nconception and of God in terms of the negative theology I have discussed in\n“The Qur'an and Life.” That is, they seek for God amid their ignorance.\n\nBy now you should able to guess why the materialist school so flourished in\nEurope. The faulty logic on questions of divinity that has held sway over\nscientists at large was doomed and bound to fail and disappear from the very\nbeginning. As I study the history of science in recent centuries and note the\npeculiar coloration given pure science simply by scientists' special turn of\nphilosophical thought, I grow saddened and discouraged.\n\nI wish scientists could become acquainted with the fine calibre of\nphilosophical thought that has evolved in the lap of the Noble Qur'an over the\nlast fourteen centuries and the limpid water of science would not remain\npolluted by that Jewish way of thinking.\n\nI am especially saddened to see those youths newly introduced to science and\nlacking the power of analysis who, reading works of modern philosophy, works\non the history of science, or even textbooks, assimilate a conception of\nscientific progress adulterated by that way of thinking. They are persuaded\nthat scientific observation discredited the hypothesis of the creation and of\nthe existence of God years ago. They think that the hypothesis of a creation\nand a Creator lives on only in the darkness of inherited beliefs and that not\na trace of it remains to be seen in the clear light of science.\n\nPerhaps what has led scientists to adopt this mode of thought is not what I\nhave termed the Jewish way of thinking, but reverence for the contents of the\nBook of Genesis. Doubtless, its contents have had a profound effect, but at\nthe most, the Book of Genesis has propounded the character of the creation in\na special manner. It has not suggested that, if organisms have come into being\nin any other way, creation has no meaning. Basically, the Book of Genesis\ncannot impart a particular conception of or way of thinking about the meaning\nof the creation. The history of scientific thought on this question indicates\nthat scientists, theists and materialists alike, have been unable to consider\nthe creation from any other standpoint than the one I have described.\n\nEven after rejecting the conception of the creation given in the Book of\nGenesis, scientists continued to regard the meaning of the creation as before.\nTherefore, some other cause is at work. I believe that cause is a pandemic way\nof thinking characteristic of the Jews and stemming from Jewish scholastic\ntheology, not from the Book of Genesis. They lack the correct, clear, and\nlogical way of thinking characteristic of those raised with study of the Noble\nQur'an.\n\nAfter noting Cuvier's theory of catastrophism, Bihzad says:\n\nIt is not unamusing to note that Louis Agassiz (another student of Cuvier and\nopponent of evolution), in order to accommodate the evolution of faunas\nobserved in the fossil record to the theory of the constancy of species,\narrived at a bizarre theory that is in a class of its own and, if closely\nexamined, sheer unbelief.",
