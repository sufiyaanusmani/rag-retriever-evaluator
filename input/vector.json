He was so fond of his Lord that he\nspent his nights worshipping, supplicating, and invoking Allah the Almighty.\n\nHis faith in Allah permeated his innermost essence until it was one of his\nmost prominent qualities and constituents.

Imam al-Jawad (a.s.) assumed the religious\nleadership and the general authority of the nation since his early years. He\nwas just seven years and some months old. He was asked about the most\ncomplicated philosophical, theological, and jurisprudential questions and he\nanswered them all as if he was an expert scholar though he was a child yet. Of\ncourse, there is no explanation for this except that which the Twelver Shia\nbelieve, that Allah has endowed the infallible Imams (a.s.)",
