Rather, his worth and importance is gauged by the parameters of correct beliefs, good deeds, ethics and \nmorality. Regarding Hazrat Abbas (a.s.), Imam Sadeq (a.s.) informs, “Our uncle, Abbas (a.s.), had complete insight. His belief was very firm and unflinching. He fought with my\n(great-grand) father, Imam Husain (a.s.).”\n(Nafasul Mahmoom p. 332)\nIf an Imam (a.s.) extols someone’s insight and belief and expresses his attachment towards him (our uncle Abbas), one can realize the greatness of the belief of such a person.
